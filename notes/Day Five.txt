Revising the models


1) Users     Good to go

Front end logic:
limit integer value to 1-10
rating a user will run a put-edit
so we will have access to the previous rating value passed down in props
during the edit- instead of placing the event.target.value directly into the put
we will store it in a temp variable
on click-function takes value Prev and value New-finds the average- and THAT is what gets sent into the back end

2) Items

add the following:

A) Image - string
B) Condition - ENUM
C) Description - string
D) Owner name - string


3) Borrow

A) duration - string
B) accepted - boolean
C) image - string
D) contact info - string



User Journey revision

1) click on the item you want
2) the item details page, will have a field to enter request details AND a button that sends the request
3) Need request inbox accesible from PROFILE
    user experience for the recipient/owner of the item:
        needs to see some sort of notification that a request has been made
            this can be achieved with a boolean from the borrow model (Borrow)
                the owner needs to be able to see relevant information:
                    - need to see the borrowers rating
                    - need to see the duration they borrower is requesting
                    - set boolean to accepted = true
                    - that action needs to send the borrower a notification and update their borrows panel in PROFILE

setBorrow( Key: value, key: value, image: 'sameurl string' )
