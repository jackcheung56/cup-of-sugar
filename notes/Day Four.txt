User Journey (Borrowing Items)

1) From ItemDetailsPage - click REQUEST BORROW
    available props on ItemDetailsPage:

        owner_id
        title

2) Creates a request
    request model attributes:

        A. recipientId -> will enable the request to appear in a userInbox
            can be set equal to owner_id

        B. listingId (itemId) -> track item 
            can be set equal to the pk of item

        C. senderId -> ? 
            need auth? (enter manually for now)
            create an input field that can take in the required ID

        D. body -> message to the user

        E. dor -> proposed date of return

3) Recipient Inbox Page - Found in User Profile

        A. Displays requests in state
        B. Maps through Request Cards
        C. Each card has a confirm or reject button
        D. Confirm will CREATE a BORROW
            borrow requires the itemId and userId
                the userId must match the request maker's id
                the itemId must match the listingId
        E. Reject will DELETE a REQUEST
